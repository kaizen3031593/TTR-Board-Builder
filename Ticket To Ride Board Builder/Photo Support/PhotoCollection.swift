/**
 A PhotoCollection represents a group of Photos that are all the same size.
 Collections are stored in a folder in the app bundle and loaded by the
 static methods provided in this class.  A PhotoCollection is a sequence.
 Thus you can iterator over collections.  Example:
 
 ```
 // get names of all folders in "Photo Collections"
 let collectionNames = PhotoCollection.namesOfCollections(inFolder: "Photo Collections")
 
 // create collection for "swatches" subfolder and iterate over the photos
 // in that collection
 let collection = PhotoCollection.collection(named: "swatches", inFolder: "Photo Collections")
 for photo in collection {
   ...
 }
 ```
 
 **Specification Properties**:
 - name : String - The name of the collection
 - self : Sequence - The photos in the collecton
 - photoSize : Size - the size of each photo
 
 **Abstract Invariant**:
 - all photos stored in the collection has size photoSize.
